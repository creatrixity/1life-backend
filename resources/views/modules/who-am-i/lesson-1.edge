      1. Under every "Kickstart Video" , (there's a new one at the beginning of each module!), you'll find your very own My 1Life Roadmap Workbook for that module!

    </p>

    <p class="module__article__text serif-stack">
      2. This course has three important components: <br />
    </p>

    <ul class="mb-3 serif-stack lead">
      <li>This web app with the Modules and Lessons</li>
      <li>The videos within each lesson</li>
      <li>The My 1Life Roadmap Workbook </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="module__article__text serif-stack">

      They all work together like pieces of the same puzzle.
      This website is your guide - your compass!
      It provides the overall direction, and as you follow along here, you'll watch the videos that provide guidance to complete the workbook!
    </p>

    <p class="module__article__text serif-stack">
      3. Each module contains a series of tools laid out in a specific sequence for a specific purpose. So if you want to jump around - don't.  Ok?  Trust the process!  We've got your back - just keep moving forward!
    </p>

    <p class="module__article__text serif-stack mb-4">
      4. Within the My 1Life Roadmap course you'll be travelling down a R.O.A.D. where each letter represents a specific process or step that builds on the one before. They're all designed to help you integrate the content, and take action! (Plus, we kinda like the acronym!)
    </p>

    <aside class="mb-4">
      <p class="h3 mb-3">R = Reflect</p>
      <p class="h3 mb-3">O = Observe</p>
      <p class="h3 mb-3">A = Act</p>
      <p class="h3 mb-3">D = Decide</p>
    </aside>

    <p class="module__article__text serif-stack">
      5. As you grow and evolve through the course, and through life, you're always welcome to flip back to review old material, dig a little deeper, re-watch the videos and redo any of the exercises. You have lifetime access to this content!
    </p>
    
    <p class="module__article__text serif-stack">
      6. Lastly, there are recommended reading lists at the end of every module workbook. These are supplementary materials, they aren't necessary to complete the course.
    </p>

    <p class="module__article__text serif-stack">
      The only "extra" resource we reference is "The Richest Man in Babylon" by George C. Clason  in Module 5. You'll need to familiarize yourself with this resource. Frankly, it's  a brilliant, short read that will change your life. If you can't get a copy,  just Google the title, and read about the concepts.
